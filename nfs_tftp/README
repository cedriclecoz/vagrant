Vagrant file to spin-up a nfs/tftp server.
Requirements:
    Vagrant installed. currently tested on Version 1.9.1
    Virtualbox installed. currently tested on Version 5.1.26 r117224 (Qt5.6.2)

Currently will be serving on the interface "en9: Thunderbolt Ethernet Slot 3"

To use:
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh -c "ifconfig" to get the ip address.

Note: I am generating a set of ssh-keys and adding it to its own authorized_key
      so the vm can ssh into itself without password.

      Usefull because in prod environment, we need to scp files to the nfs/tftp
      server those files are usually created via a jenkins job, and scp-ed via a
      script. For debug purpose, I'll be using this vm as to launch the same
      scripts.

Note2: username/password are vagrant/vagrant
